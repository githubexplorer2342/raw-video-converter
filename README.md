# raw-video-converter
 Small tool for ffmpeg I made that converts whatever file into a avi.
 It is recommended you add the bat into PATH.
 
 # Instructions
 type rawconvert (input) (output) (leave blank/laggy/accurate)
 laggy will make a slightly slower version of the video and accurate will have more accurate results but it is also slow (10fps).
